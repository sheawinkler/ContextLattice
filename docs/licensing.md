# Licensing plan

Current repo license: Business Source License 1.1 (see `LICENSE`).

Canonical legal package: `docs/legal/README.md`.

## Intended tiers

- **Free local Starter**: covered by the BSL additional use grant (local/internal usage).
- **On‑prem lite/full**: commercial license required for production use beyond the grant.
- **Hosted cloud**: commercial license required.

We can add customer‑specific license files or a commercial license agreement
once you finalize pricing/legal language.
