# Public Messaging Package

Version: 2026-02-18 (Public Beta)

## 1) Core narrative

Context Lattice is a local-first memory fabric for AI systems.
It reduces long-context waste, improves retrieval reliability, and keeps memory
durable across tooling via one orchestration layer.

## 2) Positioning statement

"Stop paying premium token costs for context chaos. Keep memory durable,
retrievable, and private with Context Lattice."

## 3) Tagline options

- Context that compounds.
- Memory that keeps agents grounded.
- Local-first memory orchestration for serious AI workflows.

## 4) Key proof points

- Sustained write path targets ~100 msg/sec with backpressure controls.
- Federated retrieval across Qdrant, Mongo raw, MindsDB, Letta, and memory-bank lexical fallback.
- Learning loop and preference-aware rerank improve retrieval quality over time.
- Local-first defaults with optional BYO cloud integrations.

## 5) Audience-specific copy

### LLM/Platform teams

Replace ad hoc context stitching with a durable orchestration layer that keeps
retrieval quality and cost predictable.

### Agent builders and vibecoders

Give your agents persistent memory and topic-scoped recall without repeatedly
stuffing huge prompts.

### Enterprise AI leads

Deploy local-first with explicit retention, auditability, and BYO-key support.

## 6) Public CTA set

- Primary: Start local-first in minutes.
- Secondary: Run a 2-4 week ROI pilot.
- Enterprise: Book an architecture review.

## 7) Launch copy templates

### X / short social post

Context Lattice is live in public beta.
Local-first memory orchestration for AI apps:
- durable writes
- federated retrieval
- queue + retention controls
- BYO cloud optional
If context drift is killing quality/cost, this is for you.

### LinkedIn post

Today we are opening Context Lattice public beta: a local-first memory fabric
for AI systems.

What it solves:
- long-context spend blowups
- inconsistent retrieval across tools
- fragile memory fanout under bursty traffic

What it ships:
- orchestrated memory write + retrieval endpoints
- federated recall (Qdrant/Mongo/MindsDB/Letta/memory-bank)
- queue telemetry, backpressure, and retention controls
- BYO cloud integrations with local-first defaults

If you want to pilot context-cost reduction and retrieval reliability, reach out.

### GitHub release notes intro

Public beta release:
- launch-readiness gate automation (soak, backup/restore drill, security preflight)
- image digest lockfile for reproducible deployments
- local-first docs and integration guides for GPT/Claude/Codex/OpenClaw paths
- legal package for hosted/commercial onboarding

## 8) Objection handling

- "Why not just bigger context windows?"
  Memory orchestration lowers token spend and improves repeatability.
- "Can we keep data local?"
  Yes. Local-first is default. Cloud sinks are optional.
- "Can we swap model providers?"
  Yes. Model/embedding providers are pluggable.

## 9) Brand voice

- Direct and technical, not hype-heavy.
- Show architecture and operational controls.
- Lead with reliability and cost outcomes, not model speculation.
