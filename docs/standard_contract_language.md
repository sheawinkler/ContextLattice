# Standard contract language (starter)

Updated: 2026-02-18

This is a lightweight commercial baseline for pilots and on-prem engagements.
Legal review is still required before external use.

## 1) Scope of services

- Provider supplies Context Lattice software and integration support for the agreed environment.
- Customer controls model provider accounts, third-party keys, and hosted infra accounts unless otherwise stated.
- Statement of work defines deliverables, support window, and acceptance criteria.

## 2) Data handling and ownership

- Customer retains ownership of all customer data and memory artifacts.
- Provider receives a limited license to process customer data solely to deliver contracted services.
- Data retention and deletion windows are defined per deployment profile and SLA.

## 3) Security and access

- BYO credentials are customer-managed by default.
- Provider access to customer systems is least-privilege and time-bounded.
- Security events and significant operational actions are logged where supported.

## 4) Availability and support

- Pilot support: best effort during business hours unless a premium support addendum applies.
- Production support tiers must specify target response times, escalation path, and maintenance windows.

## 5) Fees and payment

- Pilot fees are fixed or milestone-based.
- Ongoing subscription or support fees are documented in order form/addendum.
- Non-payment terms, suspension rights, and cure periods must be explicit.

## 6) Confidentiality

- Mutual confidentiality obligations apply to all non-public business and technical information.
- Public references/case studies require prior written consent.

## 7) IP and license

- Underlying platform IP remains with provider.
- Customer retains IP in its data, prompts, workflows, and derivative business logic.
- License grant and use restrictions follow the selected commercial terms.

## 8) Liability and warranties

- Service is provided with the agreed warranties in the order form.
- Liability caps, exclusions, and indemnity obligations must be negotiated and explicit.

## 9) Term and termination

- Define initial term, renewal mechanics, and termination for cause/convenience.
- Include data export and secure deletion obligations at termination.

## 10) Compliance addendum

- Add this section when needed for regulated customers:
  - audit requirements
  - retention/export controls
  - subcontractor disclosures
  - incident response timelines
