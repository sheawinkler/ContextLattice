# Data Processing Addendum (DPA) Baseline

Effective date: 2026-02-18

This DPA baseline applies when Context Lattice processes personal data for a
Customer under a commercial agreement.

## 1) Roles

- Customer: data controller (or processor acting on behalf of a controller).
- Provider (Context Lattice): data processor.

## 2) Processing scope

- Subject matter: memory orchestration, retrieval, storage, and operational support.
- Duration: term of applicable services agreement.
- Nature/purpose: processing directed by Customer to operate the service.
- Data subjects: Customer end users and personnel.
- Data types: content, identifiers, usage telemetry, and support artifacts.

## 3) Processor obligations

Provider will:

- process personal data only on documented Customer instructions,
- maintain confidentiality obligations for authorized personnel,
- implement reasonable security measures,
- assist Customer with data subject requests where required,
- support breach notification obligations without undue delay,
- delete or return personal data at end of services, subject to law/backup limits.

## 4) Subprocessors

Provider may engage subprocessors for hosting, observability, and operations.
Provider maintains a current list in `SUBPROCESSORS.md`.

## 5) International transfers

Where required, parties will use appropriate transfer safeguards and contractual
mechanisms in the signed agreement.

## 6) Audits

Audit rights, cadence, and evidence format are set in the commercial agreement.

## 7) Conflict

If a signed DPA in the commercial agreement conflicts with this baseline, the
signed DPA controls.
