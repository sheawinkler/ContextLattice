## 1) Relationship to repository license

The repository is distributed under Business Source License 1.1 with an
additional use grant in `LICENSE`.

Any use outside that grant requires a separate commercial license agreement.
This document defines the baseline terms for that agreement.

## 2) Commercial grant

Subject to payment and compliance with these terms, Licensor grants Customer a
non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

- use Context Lattice in production,
- run on Customer-managed infrastructure or approved hosted environments,
- create internal modifications for Customer operations.

## 3) Restrictions

Customer may not, without explicit written permission:

- offer Context Lattice as a competing hosted multi-tenant managed service,
- sublicense or redistribute source/binaries outside Customer org use,
- remove copyright/license notices.

## 4) Support and updates

Support scope, response targets, update channels, and maintenance windows are
defined in the applicable order form/SOW.

## 5) Security and compliance

- Customer remains responsible for key custody when using BYO keys/accounts.
- Licensor will provide reasonable security updates for supported versions.
- Compliance addenda (DPA, security questionnaire, data residency terms) may be
  attached per contract.

## 6) Data ownership

Customer owns Customer Data.
Licensor owns platform IP, tooling, and documentation.

## 7) Warranty and liability

Final warranty language, indemnities, disclaimers, and liability caps are set
in the signed commercial agreement.

## 8) Term and termination

- Term, renewal, and termination rights are defined in the order form.
- On termination, Customer receives agreed data export window and deletion path.

## 9) Governing law

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, baseline governing law is California, USA.

## 10) Precedence

If a signed commercial agreement conflicts with this baseline document, the
signed agreement controls.
