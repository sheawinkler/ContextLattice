# Monetization Roadmap (2026-01-24)

## Goal
Generate revenue quickly while building a long-term enterprise path.

## Core positioning
- **Tagline:** Fix the context problem plaguing vibecoders everywhere.
- **Promise:** Private, enterprise-grade context management (isolation, retention, auditability, BYOK, private networking).
- **Near-free entry:** OSS core + low-cost self-host + pay-as-you-go SaaS.

## 0–30 days (Revenue now)
**Focus:** paid pilots with LLM ops / platform teams.

Deliverables:
- Paid pilot offer (2–4 weeks) with before/after token spend report.
- ROI calculator + baseline instrumentation checklist.
- “Context cost audit” workflow and demo.

Success metrics:
- 3–5 pilots in pipeline
- 1–2 paid pilots closed
- First published ROI case study (anonymized)

## 30–60 days (Activation + onboarding)
**Focus:** smooth onboarding + vibecoder funnel.

Deliverables:
- Self-serve quickstart path + public overview README
- Low-cost hosted tier with usage metering
- Reference dashboards (context savings, latency, error rate)

Success metrics:
- 100+ active users in OSS
- 5+ teams on paid tier
- 2nd case study published

## 60–90 days (Enterprise readiness)
**Focus:** compliance, security, and procurement readiness.

Deliverables:
- Security/architecture FAQ, DPA template
- Audit logs + retention policies
- Private networking/BYOK capability

Success metrics:
- 1 enterprise pilot in progress
- 1 enterprise-ready compliance milestone

## Pricing posture
- Starter: free or very low cost (local + OSS).
- Team: usage-based + small base fee.
- Scale/Enterprise: SLA + compliance features.

## Risks and mitigations
- Slow paid conversions → tighten pilot offer + ROI proof.
- Ops cost creep → strong usage controls + cheap routing.
- Enterprise delays → prioritize platform-team revenue.
